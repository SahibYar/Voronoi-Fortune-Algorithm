# Voronoi Fortune Algorithm

A C++ program implementing Fortune's algorithm for computing Voronoi Diagram using OpenGL

 In mathematics, a <b>Voronoi diagram</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set">partitioning</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)">plane</a> into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(mathematics)">dual</a> to its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation">Delaunay triangulation</a>.
